# Banking-Management-System
<p>This Python Banking Management System is a console-based application that utilizes file handling to store user account information persistently on the system. The system allows users to perform various banking operations such as deposit, withdraw, transfer money, change PIN, edit account details, and view balance. It supports multiple users who can have accounts in multiple banks, and each user is assigned a unique account number generated using a function.</p>
